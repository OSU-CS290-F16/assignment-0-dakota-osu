            An issue that I have always had with HTML is typing all of the &#60; &#62; characters. On to a proper issue;</br>
            I have almost always done my programming on a mac, however this year I have opted for a windows machine.</br>
            Migrating to a computer running windows has had but one issue, it being navigation of the command line, to</br>
            adapt all I really must do is adapt to using a few different commands. But all in all it goes without saying</br>
            that any issues thencefore can be solved by stackoverflow.</br>

            So this is likely something to look into further later.</br>
